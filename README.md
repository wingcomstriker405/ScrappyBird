# ScrappyBird
This is the code shown in the Scrappy Bird video.
## Notes
1) In order to execute the code you need to have to screen module on your pc (not available on the workshop because of my broken pc (ill probably upload it on github and later release it on the workshop)).
2) The clean version of the code is not ment to be run as code inside Scrap Mechanic (the json file contains the code that you would need to paste as a file object inside a source file for the Programmable Processor Mod (that is registered so that the mod can access it)
